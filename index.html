    <h3>Kulapati Kanaiyalal Maneklal Munshi, had a humble origin. He was born at Broach (Gujarat) on December 30, 1887, to Tapibehn and Maneklal. He completed his school and collegiate education, the latter in Baroda where he had Sri Aurobindo as one of his teachers (1902). Sri Aurobindo's inspiring writings in Yugantar, Bande Mataram and Karmayogi were read by Munshi avidly.
      Munshi entered the legal profession in 1913 in Mumbai. With a flourishing practice at the Bar, he was, however, drawn to politics, first to Dr. Annie Besant and later to Mahatma Gandhi. Under the latter's leadership, he participated in the Salt Satyagraha in 1930 and was imprisoned for six months; later in 1932, he was sentenced to two years' rigorous imprisonment.
      Munshi's public career began with his entry into the Bombay Legislative Council in 1927 and reached its zenith in the Constituent Assembly (1946-50). As a member of the Drafting Committee of the Indian Constitution, he contributed substantially to the provisions relating to the minorities, the official language and the judiciary. He was an advocate of Hindi as the official language but was against linguistic fanaticism. He was a lover of English language and literature and harboured no hatred of the English as a race. As one who believed in the unity of India with a strong Centre, and as legal adviser to some State rulers, he played a decisive role in the integration of States; he favoured Police Action in Hyderabad as the Indian Agent there in 1948.</h5>

    <h3>Over six decades of its life, the Bhavan has been steadfastly endeavouring to hold fast to the fundamental values of life and has been fostering these values, reintegrating them with new elements suited to modern conditions.This is being accomplished through its 367 Constituent Institutions, 119 Kendras in India and 6 Overseas Centres, through its publications exceeding 1500 titles (with sales crossing 30 millions) including its monumental eleven volume history series, The History and Culture of the Indian People which have acquired world recognition, through its public libraries, through its journals in different languages, through the Sanskrit and Gita Examinations for which over 40,000 students appear every year from 550 centres, through management-staff, student-teacher dialogue, through cultural and educational tours and through All-India Colloquia, Seminars, Symposia, Lectures and Discourses on subjects of ethical and spiritual importance and through its monumental project for correlating ancient insights to modern discoveries in the fields of science, technology, life and health sciences and human values.

      Through its project Dharma Seva Pratishthan, the Bhavan has taken up repairs and renovation of old places of worship and the task of spreading the fundamental teachings of all religions and faiths. The Bhavan's Cassette Project, Amar Vani Mala, brings out the hymns and prayers of all religions in cassette forms. Culture Course Readers, specially designed for children with illustrations inculcate in young minds the spirit of unity and national integration.
      
      Through its various schools and colleges from Kindergarten to Post Graduate and Research spread all over India, the Bhavan imparts education in subjects ranging from Sanskrit, Indology, Indian Culture, Indian Classical Music, Dance, Drama, Yoga, Classical Languages and Ancient Scriptures to Arts, Science, Commerce, Engineering, Modern Management and Mass Communication and Information Technology and foreign languages like French, Spanish, Russian, German and Japanese. And through promotion of National Integration and Communal Harmony, Purity in Public Life and Rural Regeneration.
      
      Thus, Bhavan's programmes cover "all aspects of life from the cradle to the grave and beyond...it fills a growing vacuum in modern life" as Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru observed when he first visited the Bhavan in 1950.</h2>
